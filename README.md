# rxjs-learn

This is to learn more about Reactive X with javascript (RxJS), an API for asynchronous programming using observables. Includes:

1. streams (values or events emitted over time)
2. observables (facilitates the stream) and observers, 
3. subscriptions (a disposable resource, such as the execution of an Observable), 
4. subjects (behaviour, replay, async: different types of observable) and 
5. operators (methods you can use on Observables and Subjects).

This project uses [rxjs](http://reactivex.io/) version 6.3.2.

## Notes

**Webpack** is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles. _Since version 4.0.0, webpack does not require a configuration file.
